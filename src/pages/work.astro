				I work as a software engineer at <a

				> in the Data team. We're responsible for building and maintaining
				Cloudflare's internal data platform, and we partner with teams across
				the organization to support their data needs. Currently, I'm working
				on improving our research and connectivity platform to help our go-to-market
				teams obtain actionable insights during prospect research.
