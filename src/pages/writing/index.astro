  <h2>Writing</h2>
  <p>
    Every now and then I feel compelled to publish some of my thoughts. They can
    be about anything, really, but usually they are about my career,
    programming, or the industry.
  </p>

  <p>
    These posts don't have any regular cadence, they simply pop right out of my
    head whenever I feel like it is a thought worth sharing.
