# Bookmarks #1

This is Issue No. 1! I've been meaning to do this for a while. To be fair, I've been compiling a weekly list of bookmarks for the past six months or so, but I just haven't published them üòú. Since this is the first issue, I thought I'd give a quick explanation of what this is all about.

I'm a big consumer of content. I take in waaay more than I produce, and over time I think I've developed a decent intuition for separating the good from the bad. After talking with a few people, I realized my curated lists might actually be useful to others. That's one reason I decided to start publishing them. The other reason, and maybe the more important one, is that I want to produce more than I consume. Putting together a list of what I've been reading, watching, and exploring feels like low-hanging fruit toward that goal. So here we are.

I'll always start with what I've been up to recently, then share the week's bookmarks. The subject is mostly centered around programming and technology, but you will see other subjects like parenthood, self-improvement, entertainment, etc., showing up as well.

Another thing, my religion is a big part of my life. In most public contexts I like to keep it private and only talk about it when people sincerely ask; however, this is my personal space, and I reserve the right to talk openly about it here. You can expect to find bookmarks to sermons and scripture references. I will also include at least one quote from scripture or sermon from my studies every week. If this is a sensitive topic for you, just skip it.

So with these things out of the way, here is _Bookmarks #1_

### What I have been up to

I've completed my first month at Cloudflare on Thursday. So far I've been enjoying getting to know my teammates and learning about our org. I must say I'm quite proud of the work I've been doing there; with the help of my onboarding peers, I was able to get up to speed quickly and start contributing to our project. I look forward to growing with them.

I also finished [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) this week. I quite liked it. Biggest takeaway for me: there's a strong relationship between habits and identity. A good way to start developing new habits is to start framing myself as the kind of person that does them. The next book in my list is [So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you). I've been on a streak of "self-improvement" books recently; so after I'm done with this one, I'm probably going to pick up something more technical or maybe even some fiction. Haven't decided yet.

Here's a scripture passage from my studies this week.

> _Wherefore, stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord. Amen._

‚Äî [Doctrine & Covenants 87:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

### Bookmarks

- [Don't do this in code review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4jVrLj2T9c). I was planning to write a short essay on this topic, but then I came across this video and realized I'll just direct people to watch it whenever they ask me for advice about code reviews.

- [If you're remote, ramble](https://stephango.com/ramblings). I've worked remotely my entire career. What's helped me stay connected and visible to my team is being active in Slack/Teams/GChat. Steph's idea of a "ramblings" channel to share low-key updates really resonates with me. I'm personally a big fan of it, and I've seen it work.

- [No, AI is not Making Engineers 10x as Productive](https://colton.dev/blog/curing-your-ai-10x-engineer-imposter-syndrome/). What I like most about this article is its subtitle: ‚ÄúCuring Your AI 10x Engineer Imposter Syndrome.‚Äù Colton makes a strong case that the reasoning behind many claimed productivity gains is often shaky. The article resonated with me‚Äînot because it debunks the hype, but because it eases the FOMO I feel from not diving into AI as eagerly or seeing the huge productivity boosts others claim. My own gains have been modest. What really stood out was this idea: _"It's okay to sacrifice some productivity to make work enjoyable."_

- [It's time for modern CSS to kill the SPA](https://www.jonoalderson.com/conjecture/its-time-for-modern-css-to-kill-the-spa/). I like SPAs, but CSS and browser features have come such a long a way and we need to start paying more attention to them.

- [I gave the AI arms and legs ‚Äî then it rejected me](https://grell.dev/blog/ai_rejection). I'm jaded by AI talk. The hype folks make me cringe, and the doomers annoy me with their cynicism. I thought this was another doomer article, but I read it anyway because the title was interesting. In the end this was just a story about this programmer building something cool but getting rejected by the very team using his work. The cool thing about this story is that Robin maintains a pretty positive tone. I don't know, it was just a nice article.

- [You Can Just Do Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgr-WAUgELw). I keep a list of programmers I look up to, Aaron Francis not only makes that list but also the list of _people_ I look up to. This is the kind of positive message that I want to amplify.

- [Who are you jealous of?](https://twitter.com/thogge/status/1951036620116799617). This is a message about parenthood, and this was a slap in my face this week. I have two little ones at home, and a third on his way. Raising children is hard work, and most days not very _rewarding_ (if I can be honest); however, it is‚Äîno doubt‚Äîthe most _fulfilling_ work anyone can do. I know I'll miss it when it's done.

- [strudel REPL](https://strudel.cc/). I'm not even sure how I found this. I ended up spending 2 hours playing with it. To summarize, strudel is basically a way to write music by writing code instead, and it's a blast. That's really all I can say about it.

That's it for this week.

I hope you found something interesting to you, feel free to let me know by sending an email to bookmarks@lucasacastro.com. I'm always open to any suggestions as well.

Cheers,<br/>
