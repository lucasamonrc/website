You only really need one _good_ course on data structures and algorithms, and there isn't a lack of supply of free and paid options around the web. This list contains resources I actually tried and I helped me the most (none free). Just pick any resource you can find and stick with it.

### Courses, Books, and Articles

- [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Sanjoy-Dasgupta/dp/0073523402)
- [Algorithms and Data Structures for Beginners](https://neetcode.io/courses/dsa-for-beginners/)
- [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms Study Cheatsheets](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/)
- [Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious-ebook/dp/B09781V6F7)

### Curated Problem Sets

- [Grind 75](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)
- [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
- [Leetcode Top Interview 150](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-interview-150/)
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/)

### Coding Interview Etiquette

#### Dos

- Talk through your assumptions and approach
- Include the interviewer in your thought process
- Pay attention to the interviewer's cues
- Ask clarifying questions

#### Don'ts

- Start writing code without agreeing on a certain approach
- Belittle the problem or the interviewer
- Stay silent without letting the interviewer know that you are thinking
- Ignore the interviewer's tips or act hostile to them

### Interview Tips

#### Dos

- Understand all of the problems constraints
- Map out the given inputs to outputs and come up with a few of your own
- Think about how you as a human would go about solving the problem
- Remember: "I wonder? What if? Let's try!"
- Write/draw out a solution before you start coding
- Find and code a brute-force solution as fast as possible
- Walk the interviewer through your code as you type
- Test your code manually (go over each line) before stating you are done

#### Don'ts

- Just start writing without thinking about the problem
- Overthink it by trying to map out the complete problem space
- Try to validate an hypothesis (instead, try to break it!)
- Give up. If you are stuck ask/seek for help
- Try to find the optimal solution right from the start
- Run your code before reviewing and manually testing it
- Forget to mention certain assumptions
- Use a language you are not comfortable with
- Problem Solving Tips
