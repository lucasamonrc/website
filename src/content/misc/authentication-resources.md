## Resources for Learning Auth

If you have an interest on internet identity, security, and authentication, the resources below have been extremely helpful to me. I hope that they can be helpful to you too.

### Learning Resources

-   [Identity 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euKQWIEBYVU): This talk was my introduction to auth, and even though is a couple years old, it still is the first thing I tell people to watch if they want to understand internet identity and authentication.
-   [The Copenhagen Book](https://thecopenhagenbook.com/): I have found no other resource to as complete and accurate as this book. If you really want to learn **how** to build authentication services, you must read this bug. It will get you up to speed and equip you with all you need to roll your own auth.
-   [Web Authentication APIs](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-auth-apis/): If you want to learn how to build great authentication flows in the web you probably should start here. It covers email/password, social authentication, and even passkeys.
-   [An Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t18YB3xDfXI): Great introduction to OAuth and OIDC.
-   [The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749): The original OAuth 2.0 specification. It can be a little dense, but if you truly want to understand OAuth you should read this.

### Services and Frameworks

-   [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/): IMO this is currently the most solid library for building authentication in your product right now. This isn't a third-party service, so with this you're technically "rolling your own auth"
-   [WorkOS](https://workos.com/): I've used WorkOS extensively, and I've found they truly deliver in their promise of making your app "enterprise ready." If you are considering a third-party identity service, I strong recommend you check them out.
-   [Clerk](https://clerk.com/): Strong contender for identity service. I don't have a lot of experience working with it but I've heard a lot of good things about it.

### From Me

I've written and presented on the subject of auth a few times already, so if you're interested please check it out.

-   [Auth 101](http://localhost:4321/writing/auth-101): My own version of a "introduction to auth" lecture in a long-form post. I've also presented at the Remix Austin meetup in early 2025. You can find that presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8iFDkBRfWI).
-   [Getting Started with Passkeys and WebAuthn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSxibbZ3GL4): My talk about WebAuthn and Passkeys at the UtahJS 2024 conference.
