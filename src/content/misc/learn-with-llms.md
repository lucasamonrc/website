# Using LLMs to Learn a New Programming Language

> The main benefit I’ve seen from using Copilot Chat is the decreased feeling of “loneliness” when learning a new language. The chat feature does feel more of a “copiloting” experience, as if I was pair programming with someone. Here are some practical dos and don’ts I came up with when integrating copilot chat in my learning process.

## Language Exploration

### Dos

- Request code examples
- Ask to explain documentation
- Translate code to other language
- Evaluate small experiments

### Don’ts

- Not consult official documentation
- Provide huge chunks of code to explain
- Ask to validate assumptions

## Familiar Minor Project

### Dos

- Ask to generate project boilerplate
- Ask to organize basic requirements
- Ask questions about design patterns

### Don’ts

- Let it do all the work
- Try to understand generated boilerplate

## Coding Problems

### Dos

- Use it as a cheatsheet
- Ask about available APIs/Data Structures
- Ask for test cases
- Request hints

### Don’ts

- Ask to write the algorithm
- Use it as an autocomplete feature
- Ask for it to solve the problem

## Capstone Project

### Dos

- Use chat as a rubber duck
- Generate basic automated test suite

### Don’ts

- Use auto-complete features
- Ask for hints
- Use auto-generated boilerplate
