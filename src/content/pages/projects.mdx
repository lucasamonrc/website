## Tiny Projects

On occasion, I like to tinker and program tiny projects of interesting algorithms, tools, programs, and more to keep my skills sharp and explore new domains that I may not get the chance to work with in my day job.

Here's a list of the tiny projects I've worked on:

<ul>
  {TINY_PROJECTS.map((project, i) => (
    <li key={i}>
      <a href={project.url}>{project.title}</a>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
