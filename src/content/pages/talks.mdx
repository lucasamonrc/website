## Talks

I like to engage with the dev community thorugh talks and presentations. It is
also a good way to share things I've learned and meet new people, so I try to
give a talk or two every year. Here's a list of some of the talks I've given:

<ul className="p-0">
  {TALKS.map((talk, i) => (
    <TalkEntry
      key={i}
      date={talk.date}
      title={talk.title}
      videoUrl={talk.videoUrl}
      notesUrl={talk.notesUrl}
      slidesUrl={talk.slidesUrl}
    />
  ))}
</ul>
