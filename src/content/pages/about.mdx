<p className="mt-0">Hello, there! I'm Lucas.</p>

I work as software engineer at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). Previously I was a founding engineer at [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id), and before that I was attending school at [BYU](https://byu.edu) in Provo, UT.

I like to [write](/writing) every now and then, and about once a year I give a [talk](/talks) at a developer conference or local meetup.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasamonrc), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasamonrc), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lucasamoncastro).

### Contact

I enjoy meeting new people! You're always welcome to send me an email at [hello@lucasacastro.com](mailto:hello@lucasacastro.com). I like chatting about programming, games, parenthood, and religion. If you want to talk about something else, that's fine too!
