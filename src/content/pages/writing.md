## Writing

Every now and then I feel compelled to publish some of my thoughts. They can be about anything, really, but usually they are about my career, programming, or the industry.

Recently, I decided to start publishing my weekly content bookmarks and add a small commentary to each one of them with my thoughts about what I read. You can find them in my [bookmarks](/bookmarks) page.

The posts below don't have any regular cadence, they simply pop right out of my head whenever I feel like it is a thought worth sharing.
