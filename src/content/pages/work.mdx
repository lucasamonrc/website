## Work

I do my best work in fast-paced, cross-functional teams, and I like to own my projects end-to-endâ€”design, implementation, and release.

While the majority of my experience is in product engineering, I'm always happy to work with infrastructure and platform. I'm very comfortable with TypeScript, C#, Go, web servers, databases, queues, and distributed systems.

I work as a software engineer at [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) on the Business Intelligence team. We're responsible for building and maintaining Cloudflare's internal data platform. We steward the company's vast datasets and partner with teams across the organization to support their data needs.

Right now, I'm working on improving our research and connectivity platform to help our go-to-market teams obtain actionable insights during prospect research.

Previously, I was one of [Trinsic's](https://trinsic.id) founding engineers. Trinsic is on a crusade against document scans in online identity verification, and their platform helps businesses verify users more securely and quickly by connecting them to digital IDs.

Before that, I was a attending school at [BYU](https://byu.edu), and I graduated with a degree in Computer Science in 2023. During that time I took on several programming part-time jobs and internships, most notably at [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com) and [Utah County Government](https://utahcounty.gov).

Here's where I've worked:

<ul>
  {WORK.map((work, i) => (
    <WorkEntry
      key={i}
      position={work.position}
      company={work.company}
      companyUrl={work.companyUrl}
      range={work.range}
    />
  ))}
</ul>
